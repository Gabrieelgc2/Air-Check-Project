# Air Check Project

## Description

The **Air Check** project is an application for monitoring indoor air quality. It allows users to track pollutant levels, such as CO2, fine particles, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in real time. By using sensors installed in different rooms, the application displays graphs and alerts to ensure a healthy environment.
